# 1 Introduction

In this lab we used automated unit testing in order to test the methods of org.jfree.data.Range (in the package org.jfree.data) and the methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities (in the package org.jfree.data). We tested methods from each of these classes. In order to test these methods, we used Java SE, JUnit and JMock libraries. We specifically used JMock library for testing the methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities (in the package org.jfree.data).

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Since we are doing Black box testing, we decided to do Equivalence Class Testing (ECT) to test the 10 methods that we had to test from both of the classes. We also did Boundary Value Testing (BVT) for one of the methods of org.jfree.data.Range. For both of these classes we made separate test classes, i.e. the test cases for the methods of org.jfree.data.Range are in "RangeTest.java" and the test cases for the moethods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities are in "DataUtilitiesTest.java".

A. The following methods were tested in RangeTest.java in the following manner:

1) getLength(): This function was tested using ECT. We planned to partition its tests into two equivalence classes. For the range -1 to 1, the first equivalence class was tested with the value "2" and the second equivalence class was tested with the value "239991.75". We wanted to test both large and small values.

2) getLowerBound(): This function was also tested using ECT. We planned to partition its tests into two equivalence classes. For the range -1 to 1, the first equivalence class was tested with the value "-1" and the second equivalence class was tested with the value "-99995.875". We wanted to test both large and small values.

3) getUpperBound(): This function was also tested using ECT. We planned to partition its tests into two equivalence classes. For the range -1 to 1, the first equivalence class was tested with the value "1" and the second equivalence class was tested with the value "139995.875". We wanted to test both large and small values.

4) contains(double value): This function was tested using ECT and Boundary Value Testing (BVT). We planned to partition its tests into six equivalence classes. For the range -1 to 1, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth equivalence classes were tested with the values "1", "-1", "0", "2", "-99999" and "140000" respectively. We wanted to test both large and small values.

5) intersects(double lower, double upper):  This function was tested using ECT. We planned to partition its tests into three equivalence classes. For the range -1 to 1, the first, second, and third equivalence classes were tested with the values "1", "-1,2", "139995.876, 149995.875",and "-1099995, -99995.876" respectively. We wanted to test both large and small values.

B. The following methods were tested in DataUtilitiesTest.java in the following manner:

A. The following methods from org.jfree.data.Range were tested in RangeTest.java:

1) public double getLength():
    The names of the test methods to test this function are as follows:

    a) public void getLengthTestTwo()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value expected value "2".

    b) public void getLengthTestLargeRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value expected value "239991.75".

2) public double getLowerBound():
    The names of the test methods to test this function are as follows:

    a) public void getLowerBoundTestNegOne()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value expected value "-1".

    b) public void getLowerBoundTestLargeRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value expected value "-99995.875".

3) public double getUpperBound():
    The names of the test methods to test this function are as follows:

    a) public void getUpperBoundTestOne()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value expected value "1".

    b) public void getUpperBoundTestLargeRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value expected value "139995.875".

4) public boolean contains(double value):
    The names of the test methods to test this function are as follows:

    a) containsTestOneInRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "1" and the expected value should be "true".

    b) public void containsTestNegOneInRange() 

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "-1" and the expected value should be "true".

    c) public void containsTestZeroInRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "0" and the expected value should be "true".

    d) public void containsTestTwoOutOfRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "2" and the expected value should be "false".
        
    e) public void containsTestLargeNegOutOfRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "-99999" and the expected value should be "false".

    f) public void containsTestLargePosOutOfRange()
    
        This method tests the equivalence class with value "140000" and the expected value should be "false".

5) public boolean intersects(double lower, double upper):
    The names of the test methods to test this function are as follows:

    a) public void intersectsTestInRange()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "-1, 2" and the expected value should be "true".

    b) public void intersectsTestOutOfRangeAbove()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "139995.876, 149995.875" and the expected value should be "false".

    c) public void intersectsTestOutOfRangeBelow()

        This method tests the equivalence class with value "-1099995, -99995.876" and the expected value should be "false".


# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

To start of the lab, each group member was responsible for familiarizing themselves with Eclipse, creating a JUnit test, and viewing the Javadoc API speifications. Then, when the group was ready to develop unit test code, we paired up and split up tasks. Samira and Farica worked on range testing, and Michele and Carter worked on DataUtilities testing. Working in pairs allows each member to be involved and can verify code for logic purposes. At the end, when each pair completed their unit tests and made sure it worked, the group came together and discussed all the tests created for feedback and approval. Finally, everyone in the team helped create the final report.  


# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Prior to this lab, the group, in general had very minimal knowledge of JUnit testing. This is another reason why we have decided to partner up and work on two devices rather than let each member work on their own. There were some challenges/difficulties that the group encountered. For example when creating tests, we originally thought that we only needed one test per class, but with equivalence class testing, we had to create more than just one test per class. Another challenge was understanding JMock since most of the group was unfamiliar with it prior to this course. Throughout this lab, members became more comfortable with writing JUnit tests, using Eclipse, and more.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Our group thought that the lab was a great exercise for learning about how to create JUnit tests and familiarizing ourselves with Eclipse. Compared to the last lab document, we think it was a little easier to follow, but the document still contained a lot of information which was easy to get lost in. Overall, the group enjoyed the lab.
