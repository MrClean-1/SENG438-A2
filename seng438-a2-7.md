# 1 Introduction

In this lab we used automated unit testing in order to test the methods of org.jfree.data.Range (in the package org.jfree.data) and the methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities (in the package org.jfree.data). We tested methods from each of these classes. In order to test these methods, we used Java SE, JUnit and JMock libraries. We specifically used JMock library for testing the methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities (in the package org.jfree.data).

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed 

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
