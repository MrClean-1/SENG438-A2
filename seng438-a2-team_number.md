# 1 Introduction

In this lab we used automated unit testing in order to test the methods of org.jfree.data.Range (in the package org.jfree.data) and the methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities (in the package org.jfree.data). We tested methods from each of these classes. In order to test these methods, we used Java SE, JUnit and JMock libraries. We specifically used JMock library for testing the methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities (in the package org.jfree.data).

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Since we are doing Black box testing, we decided to do

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

To start of the lab, each group member was responsible for familiarizing themselves with Eclipse, creating a JUnit test, and viewing the Javadoc API speifications. Then, when the group was ready to develop unit test code, we paired up and split up tasks. Samira and Farica worked on range testing, and Michele and Carter worked on DataUtilities testing. Working in pairs allows each member to be involved and can verify code for logic purposes. At the end, when each pair completed their unit tests and made sure it worked, the group came together and discussed all the tests created for feedback and approval. Finally, everyone in the team helped create the final report.
